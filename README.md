## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JavaScript framework

### Useful resources

- [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) - This is where all the advices come from.
- [JavaScript Fetch API](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/api_fetch.asp) - This helped me to use fetch correctly.
- [Media Queries with JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_media_queries.asp) - This helped me to change the divider icon depending on the size of the screen.

### Running the project locally

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Acknowledgments

The [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) sometimes returned the same data. [This link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71255840/fetch-api-return-same-data-always) (see Marcos Fitzsimons' answer) provided a solution to avoid this.
